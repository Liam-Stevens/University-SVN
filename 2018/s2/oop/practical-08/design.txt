Design:
Start with an amount of money
You start on a screen with list of shops/vendors
You can choose to go to a shop with a command (each shops buys and sells types of items at different prices based on what they normally sell)
You can choose to view your inventory at any time (including money avaliable)
When you get to the shop, you are given a list of items for purchase, their price and quantity avaliable
You may choose to spend money to buy an item or choose to sell an item from your inventory at a price the vendor specifys (size of item, the type of item)

Objective: To buy stuff
