			<h1>This page is all about divs!</h1>
			<br>
			<p>This page looks much cleaner now that I've put my content in a div with white background.</p>
			<p>Because this div is special, it has it's own id, "content".<br>This allows us to differentiate it from other divs and give it a white background.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>This is a normal paragraph, except <span class="blue">this span of text is blue</span> <span class="fancy">and this span has a font-family of cursive</span>, because they belongs to two classes called "blue" and "fancy" respectively.</p>
			<p>On the other hand, <span class="blue fancy">this span of text is both blue and fancy!</span></p>

		<div>
			<p>This text is inside a normal div, but the background has not been set.</p>
